# hello-world

Hi there. I am zShan. I love making stuff. I know C, C++, Java and a little bit of JavaScript. 
Currently I am learning python. Apparently python is much more simpler and powerful which makes me think I should've started with python.
No regrets though. syotos.
this is my first attempt at using github. apparently you're not a developer unless you know how to use github (among other things ðŸ˜…). so here I am. See you on the other side
